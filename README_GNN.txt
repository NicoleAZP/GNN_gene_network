# Graph Neural Network (GNN) Project

## Introduction

This project involves the implementation of a Graph Neural Network (GNN), which is a type of deep learning model designed to work directly with graph-structured data. GNNs are widely used for various tasks such as node classification, graph classification, link prediction, and other tasks where the relationships between nodes and edges play a crucial role. The model presented here leverages the principles of message passing between nodes to generate useful embeddings for downstream tasks.

## File Structure

- **GNN.py**: This script contains the implementation of the Graph Neural Network (GNN) model. The GNN is designed to handle various types of graphs and supports common GNN layers like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs).

## Dependencies

To run the code, you will need the following Python packages:

- `torch` (PyTorch)
- `torch-geometric` (PyTorch Geometric)
- `networkx`
- `numpy`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install torch torch-geometric networkx numpy
```

## Usage

To train the GNN model, you can run the `GNN.py` script:

```bash
python GNN.py
```

Make sure to adjust the input graph data, model parameters, and any other settings based on your specific use case.
